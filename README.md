# The buddy app! 

half social experiment, half improv challenge, half friend on demand, the buddy app is an app whose goal is to help people always have a friend (or stranger) by their side. 

With the goal of eliminating awkward interactions, (or creating more), the buddy app uses location data to find the closest people near you to come to your aid based on a prompt you send out as a beacon for aid. 

Laid back enough to be used for situations of being alone at lunch, but useful enough to help people get out of potentially dangerous encounters, buddy is an alibi generator for the masses.
